# Created stored procedures, functions, views and triggers to automate data management and handle session bookings.
# Managed user logins, roles, and permissions to secure sensitive client and session data.
# Migrated data from SQL Server Management Studio to local MongoDB database and to Google Cloud through MongoDB Atlas, ensuring scalability.
# Developed reports and deployed them using SQL Server Reporting Services (SSRS) for web access.
# Automated backup jobs, including full, differential, index optimization, and log file backups, using SQL Server Agent Jobs to maintain data integrity and high availability.
# Optimized database performance by creating indexes, tuning queries, and implementing efficient functions, reducing response times and improving system efficiency.
